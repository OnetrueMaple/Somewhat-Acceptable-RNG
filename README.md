# Somewhat-Acceptable-RNG
Trying to make an RNG that is as good as possible. If I can get timing samples to pass most randomness tests (PractRand, Dieharder, NIST Test Suite)...
I'll consider that good enough.

For now, I will use python. It's about 20x~200x slower than C or another low level language. I'll rewrite this in C once I'm satisfied.
